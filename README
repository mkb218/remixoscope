ideas:
- this is a take off on loopcollector
- constantly record from as many inputs as possible. each channel is independent, i.e. stereo input creates two sets of samples
- assemble predefined rhythm tracks using pieces. once again each track is independent. stereo inputs create two sets of buckets that are filled separately and played back together. mono tracks create a single bucket played back in mono. won't consider more than two channels.
- how do we do this? take a recording of a loop. split it into X frequency bands. split each band into 32nd notes.
- do the same with incoming audio.
- when reassembling audio, stop taking pieces into each of the original loop's buckets when it's full
- once a track is completely filled, queue incoming samples. drop oldest sample when a set of new samples would be as loud
- there needs to be a gate on samples that are accepted
- app will need a file that describes each input track (number of measures, file format, # channels can be discovered)
- choosing next track to playback is at random. choosing next track whose buckets to fill is also random
- analysis only needs to be done once and results can be saved
- RMS values for all
- i sort of want to use this as an instrument, i need some MIDI things for timing purposes

go language-wise seems well suited for a file based non realtime version this project, primarily because of goroutines. 
- for audio file i/o, i will need to use either cgo to call out to libsox or pipes to do ipc. ipc is probably easier but requires reading the file many times.
- for signal processing i am left with my own hacky stuff
- maybe make a wrapper for the dft_filter functions that copy output to a second buffer?

pd may work. super collider too. nsound. impromptu. check out capabilities of all of them.

in fact, i think i need to split this into two parts.

the analyzer will work on input audio files, and spit out descriptor files.
MAYBE work on audio files

something else will consume them. file based stuff in go.
