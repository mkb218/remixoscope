ideas:
- this is a take off on loopcollector
- constantly record from selected input
- assemble predefined rhythm and melody tracks using pieces
- how do we do this? take a recording of a loop. split it into X frequency bands. split each band into 32nd notes.
- do the same with incoming audio.
- when reassembling audio, stop taking pieces into each of the original loop's buckets when it's full
